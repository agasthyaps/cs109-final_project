## Problem Statement and Motivation 

Alzheimer's is a type of dementia that causes impairments and gradual decline in memory, thinking and behaviour. It is an irreversible process typically occurring in people over the age of 60 and is found to relate with accumulation of Amyloid Beta protein in the patients' brain. While some drugs and non-drug treatments help in controlling cognitive and behavioral symptoms, the disease currently has no cure. This has resulted in Alzheimer's being the third leading cause of death in old people and heavy economic and social impact of the disease. 

Early detection of Alzheimer's can greatly impact the potency of any therapy. In this project, we evaluate the effectiveness of individual cognitive tests in dementia detection. Based on this study, we build a meta-test that can enhance the diagnosis of patients as compared to individual tests. We also study how and which cognitive tests are useful in detecting brain measurements.
